      <p id="about me">
	Name: Laith Sadri <br>
	Nickname: None <br>
	Birthplace: Denton, Texas <br>
	Age: 15 <br>
	Hobbies: Art, programming, editing <br>
	Two people I'd like to meet: Louie Zong, Niel Ciciriega <br>
	When I finish school I plan to: Move to a small northern european country and live far from any cities in an off the grid address. Then I will be happy. <br>
	The last movie I saw: Hm, I think it was the Neon Genesis Evangellion finale? <br>
	I wish I knew how to: be really fluent in Javascript (NOT java) and GDScript <br>
	My hero is: Niel Ciciriega <a style="display: inline;" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=niel+cic+xoxo+talk&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1039US1039&oq=niel+cic+xoxo+talk&aqs=chrome..69i57.4767j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:6ae3398f,vid:TB7fqT1uAII">seriously watch this talk he did at the XOXO festival</a> <br>
	I'm happiest when: doing my own thing w/out disruption for days on end <br>
	college I wish to attend: Digipen Institute of Technology, if anything, but honestly I've taught myself enough of the skills I need to be successful.<br>
	I drive a: nothing, I never want to own a car, though I might need to if I am to live in an off the grid house. <br>
	When I grow up I want to: man, the idea of doing anything just sounds disgusting to me. getting a job because im told i need to, working for 40 years and dying? that is dystopian. look at where you are right now, away from your monitor, and tell me your ancestors wouldn't be terrified. <br>
